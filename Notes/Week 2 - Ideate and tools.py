Lecture 
- Finding and Refining gaps
- First deliverable: abstract
    - Motvations: What are mine? Why am I intrerested in this topic?
    - What are the gaps in the literature? What are the questions that have not been answered?
    - look at recmmondations from other papers with 'future research' section
    - Can you bring a unique perspective to the topic?
    - Write down ideas, scriblles, thoughts, etc.
    - 

"Machine learning in living organisms.." -so normal learning?


Why are they just showcasing research that is only related to veyr specific topics?? 
As if we're not able to think og these motivations ourselves. 
It's just showing their own research. It doesn't deviate from the normal prcatice of research...

For sustainable 3D printing: You're just going to be doing the things that the researcher does not
want to do themselves. all these tests are tedious work. Gathering these material insights is 
in any normal siuation done by a large company that specilizes in this. Not by a swarm of students.


- Where do ideas come from?
    - Inquiry vs invention
    - From idea to solution
    - from problem to solution
- Vuzix Z100: example of smart glasses
- Prbolem solving
    - People dont want a quarter inch drill, they want a quarter inch hole
    - Emphatize, deinge, ideate, prototype, test
    - how to not reinvent the wheel
- How do you know what the gaps are in the knowledge?
    - What are the boundaries of your searc,?
    What is in/out of your preokct?
    What are keywords people are using?
    What are you looking for? Detials of atechnique or design method?
- Keyword research
    - User BOOL operators, AND, OR, NOT
    - use this in your query
    - Acually use AND, OR, NOT in your search in Scholar
    - use ~ for synonyms!!
    - Also jus search for operators
    - 
- Where to search
    - HCI: ACM library
    - IEEE
    = Google Scholar
    - Scopus
    - Web of Science
    - Springer
    - Science Direct
    - JSTOR
    - ResearchGate

- Tools to help
    - Mendeley
    - !!!Connected papers!!! - visualized a networked map
    - Mendely: can see what other people are reading
    - Zotero
    - Endnote
    - RefWorks
    - Plugins with Google docs to automate workflow

-Turning it into words
    - Move step model
        Move 1 establishing the field
            Scope of the research and what has been done
            Step 1: Claiming centrality
                Interesintg, sginingficant, important, relevant, timely, etc.
            Step 2 stating the current knowledge and degining terms
                Generally, such as, common, for example, most people,
            Step 3: Reviewing previous research
                Much research, has inbeestigated, found, arues, has been concluded, 
                has been studied, stated, claims, studied
        Move 2: establiching the nieche
            Step 1: counter claiming
            Step 2: indicating a gap
            Step 3: Raising questions
            Step 4, cotinuing a tradition
        Move 3: Occupying the niche
    - Do this for each category/cluster of your research
    - Summarise into one coherent "Gap"
