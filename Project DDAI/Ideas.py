- Let an Agent use Social media, and see what it learns
- Create a tamagochi comapanion that dies with too much SM use
- Let two agents try to persuade each other of oppposing views


- capture data to map subconscious proccesses and try to use that data to optimize towards a personal goal
    - Data patterns that shape behavior on social media - transition from engagement and retention to usefull

    
- Pure news feed that is based in social media, so cpature quick interest and then allow for more exploration
