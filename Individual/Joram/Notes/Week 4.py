---- Week 4 lecture notes: -----
- Planning research activities and documenting the right stuff

"Main reserach question for the group"
- Activities as individual focus on sub-questions/topics
- AVOID dependencies on other group members
    - design them out of the project
    - PICK WHAT YOU WANT
    - do not let the group decide whay you should do for your research
    - 

Design your experiment:
- Work out what your variables are
- Wirite a specific, testable hyopthesis
- What do you need to know first before you take further steps?
- Consdier if you need to design a way to manipulate one variable at a time
- Determenine how you should measure/document your variable
    - How you intend to analyse the resulta will impact what you document
Back to step 2 and repeat (but not forever)

Documenting you design research:
- For yourself -- document everything
- to do it again -- ingredients in the recipe, technical files
- to analyse -- measurement, images, video, before/after
- to share in research for communication -- Vsualisation, storytelling. To communicate a point
" !!! No documentation !!! == missing, mistakes, and redo"






----TODO-----
So we need to:
- Define the main research question
- Define the sub-questions, each picked by an individual
- Define the activities for each sub-question
- Define the deliverables for each activity
    - Set the deadlines!
- Locate artifacts to be developed for each sub-question
    - What does everyone need to make in order to test?
