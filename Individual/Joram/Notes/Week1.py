- Design research droft from one idea to another and from method to method.

RTD - Research through design
knowledge the you create during this course merges throufh engaging in design activities
Prototypes are more than products, they are research artefacts

"Permission ot muck about" A movie about the messy process of RTF

Design research is about the process, not the product
involves a lot of trial and error
ie. the process of making a prototype is more important than the prototype itself

-- Panel Discussion --
A lot of info about the way these researchers use MMR/Qual/Quant

"You have to let go of doing it to please someone else. true findings appear when you start thinking for yourself""
