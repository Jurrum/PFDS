By combining insights from these papers, we can improve social media feed design in the following ways:
✅ User Agency: Shift from passive consumption to interactive, teachable feeds.
✅ Transparency: Users should understand why they see content and be able to adjust feed parameters.
✅ Balance: Prevent filter bubbles by ensuring a healthy mix of exploration and personalization.
✅ Trust & Literacy: Fact-checking should be integrated, educational, and engaging to combat misinformation.
✅ Ethical Data Use: Privacy-respecting engagement tracking is necessary to reduce the observer effect bias.

1. Refining User Control Over Algorithmic Feeds
        While teachable feeds have been explored, there is little empirical work on how users would actively engage with these systems (Paper 1).
        Research should investigate interface usability when integrating interactive machine teaching for content personalization (Paper 1).
2. Studying the Impact of Personalized Feeds on Mental Well-being
        There is limited empirical data on the long-term psychological effects of extreme personalization vs. diverse content exposure (Paper 4).
        Research should explore the relationship between user agency in feeds and digital well-being.
3. Balancing Algorithmic Recommendations with Human-Curated Content
        Hybrid models that combine automated ranking with user-driven prioritization could be studied in detail (Paper 1, 4).
        Investigate how much control users actually want vs. how much automated decision-making is preferred (Paper 4).
4. Understanding the Observer Effect in Real-World Social Media Use
        More studies should analyze how self-awareness impacts engagement patterns over time, especially in public vs. private settings (Paper 5).
        Future research should focus on privacy-aware engagement tracking to minimize behavioral distortion (Paper 5).
5. Evaluating the Effectiveness of Gamified Interventions in Social Media
        While "Fakey" showed promising results, more research is needed to scale gamified literacy tools for diverse audiences (Paper 3).
        Studying gamification beyond news literacy, such as improving algorithm awareness and engagement habits, could be valuable (Paper 3).
6. Investigating Political and Ideological Biases in Algorithmic Feeds
        Research should examine whether misinformation flagging disproportionately affects different political groups (Paper 2).
        More work is needed to prevent algorithmic amplification of ideological biases (Paper 2, 4).
