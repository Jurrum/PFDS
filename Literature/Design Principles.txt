---- Design principles for Social media feed design ----


--- Joram ---
1. Enhance User Control Over Feed Customization (Personalization & Agency)
Implement teachable algorithms where users can provide explicit feedback to train the system (Paper 1, Paper 4).
Introduce "interactive machine teaching" (IMT) principles to allow users to define relevance signals beyond just likes and follows (Paper 1).
Allow users to manually adjust content exposure settings, such as toggling between exploration vs. exploitation modes in recommendation systems (Paper 4).

2. Improve Transparency and Explainability in Algorithmic Feeds
Display clear, human-readable explanations of why a post appears in a feed (Paper 2, Paper 4).
Provide real-time control dashboards where users can tweak algorithmic biases (Paper 1, Paper 4).
Include fact-checking explanations for flagged misinformation to increase trust (Paper 2).

3. Integrate Gamification and Educational Elements for Digital Literacy
Use interactive, gamified interventions like "Fakey" to train users to critically assess news sources (Paper 3).
Create educational prompts in feeds to guide users on identifying low-credibility content (Paper 3).

4. Support Multi-Dimensional Feed Customization (Beyond Likes and Shares)
Use a variety of engagement signals beyond just clicks and watch time, including content depth, user intent, and thematic preferences (Paper 1, Paper 4).
Allow users to categorize followed accounts into customized content groups, prioritizing human connections over content-based ranking (Paper 1).

5. Mitigate Filter Bubbles and Algorithmic Manipulation Risks
Design algorithmic diversity mechanisms that ensure periodic exploration of new content rather than reinforcing existing biases (Paper 4).
Introduce "diverse content nudges" that encourage users to engage with a broader range of viewpoints (Paper 2, Paper 3).
Implement "bounded personalization", where the system intentionally introduces a mix of familiar and novel content (Paper 4).

6. Account for the Observer Effect in Social Media Behavior
Acknowledge that users behave differently when they know they are being observed, leading to potential biases in engagement data (Paper 5).
Conduct longitudinal research to account for behavioral shifts over time, rather than relying on snapshot analyses (Paper 5).
Provide privacy-preserving customization tools that allow users to experiment with feed settings without fear of being tracked (Paper 5).
